This was a talk I gave to our journal club on the use of long-read sequencers for genomics and RNA analysis. I follow a few of the nanopore people on twitter, their [yearly conference (at least via hashtag)](https://twitter.com/nanopore/status/961555827181150208), and wanted to know a bit more about the technology. I also used this as an opportunity to try out using [Xaringan](https://yihui.name/en/2017/08/why-xaringan-remark-js/) for making presentations. This is an html5/R markdown based presentation-making alternative to powerpoint. I think I'll keep this in the workflow!

A recent publication from [Snow *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24059) put forth a huge data set on the prevalence of *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria in sub-Saharan Africa since 1900.

A big portion of the work I currently focus on is related to the seasonal transmission dynamics of malaria, hinging on the dry-season behavior of *Anopheles coluzzii* and *Anopheles gambiae* s.s. mosquitoes in Mali. I wanted to see if from this data set I could get a better handle on defining the transmission season in Mali and across Africa ( [especially as much of the malaria transmission is seasonal across Africa](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15535) ).

Watch this space as I flesh out some of the ideas, but as a brief snippet here is a k-nearest neighbor smoothed figure of monthly malaria transmission using data from 1990 on.
